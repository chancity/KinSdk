# TERMS OF SERVICE

## Version 1.0 06 July 2019 (GDPR COMPLIANT)

1. Thank you for signing up to use the Trackin application (the "app", "Platform", "Website", "Trackin Application" or the "Trackin Platform"), and related products and services (together, we'll call these the "Services") of Trackin Network Ltd. ("Trackin Network Ltd", "Trackin", "us", "we" or "our"), and any of our affiliates with authorized links to this Agreement. The term "you" refers to the natural person accessing or otherwise using our Services.

2. This Terms of Service Agreement (or "Terms" for short) describes the rules of our relationship with you and is a legal agreement, so please read it carefully.

3. Trackin can be used across multiple platforms including website, mobile app and consoles.

4. By using the app or website or platform you agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. Use includes using the app or website in any capacity, including as an unregistered user, downloading the app, using the website and registering as a Trackin user. By using Trackin as described or in any other manner that constitutes use of the platform you represent that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use these services.

### 5. Arbitration Agreement

We wanted to let you know that these terms include an arbitration agreement( also known as alternative dispute resolution agreement) which will, with limited exceptions, require disputes between us to be submitted to binding and final arbitration. unless you opt out of the arbitration agreement: (1) you will only be permitted to pursue claims and seek relief against us on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class, collective or representative action or proceeding; and (2) you are waiving your right to seek relief in a court of law and to have a jury trial on your claims. We also wanted to let you know that the Trackin platform contains features and functionalities that may provide you with access to opportunities to earn and spend kin. You acknowledge and agree that some of these features and functionalities are still under development and have been released to you as a user with full disclosure that at these early stages of development you may lose access to your wallet and any kin that you have earned.

### 6. Kin and the Hosting of Your Kin Wallet

Kin can be described as a digital currency like Bitcoin or Ether which has value on the openmarket. Your Kin wallet holds the Kin you have been rewarded through gameplay or by other means. For the initial Beta release of Trackin, Trackin Network Ltd will host your Kin Wallet and as such have influence over the Kin in your wallet in order for us to enact your instructions which could include converting all or some of your Kin into Gems if you choose or transferring your Kin to another wallet that you specify. In due course Trackin will replace hosted Kin wallets with user controlled wallets where you will have sole access and control of the Kin in your Trackin Kin Wallet. You acknowledge that anyone who has access to your unlocked device, computer or console or any other device may be able to spend Kin that you have stored within your Kin wallet.

### 7. Gems

Gems are the rewards points of the Trackin Platform, they are non-refundable, non-transferable and do not hold any monetary value. Trackin users are able to exchange Kin they have been rewarded or received via other platform activities for Gems. Trackin Network Ltd will provide opportunities to redeem your Gems for items such as gift cards. 500 Gems = $5 Gift Card. These redemption opportunities may change, be put on hold or withdrawn at anytime without warning.

### 8. Kin Rewards for In-Game Achievements and Daily Gems Supercharge

Trackin Network provides a Daily Gem Supercharge whereby a specified amount of Kin can be supercharged to provide a higher amount of Gems than the Kin is worth on the open market. Supercharge provides the user with a subsidised value of Kin relative to the Gems paid out. Supercharge helps users get to the goal of 500 Gems = $5 gift card quicker. Both the threshold amount of Kin and the number Gems paid out are subject to change at the complete discretion of Trackin Network Ltd. Trackin is able to pay out Kin based on the income received from partners including Advertisers and Game Providers. A significant portion of this variable income is shared with users hence Trackin reserves the right to cease or pause rewarding users entirely or adjusting:

- the amount of Kin paid for in game achievements,

- The amount of Kin required to claim a Daily Gem Supercharge

- The number of Gems in each Daily Supercharge

### 9. Trackin Shared Revenue Model

The Trackin business model of rewarding users for engagements operates on a shared revenue basis where revenue received from advertisers or other partners is shared with our users via Kin payments and Gem boosts and any other means we may use in the future.

### 10. Regulatory Considerations

It is important to note that the services provided by Trackin Network Ltd in relation to the storage, payment of and facilitation of peer to peer transfers (a future Trackin feature) of the Kin Cryptocurrency are currently unregulated in the United Kingdom. Cryptocurrencies are not regulated by the FCA (and the UK's money laundering authority) on this basis they do not fall within the scope of the UK's measures implementing the Payments Services Directive, the Second Electronic Money Directive or the Third Money Laundering Directive. The 5th AMLD (European Union Anti Money Laundering Directive) which comes into mandatory effect in January 2020 places new regulatory requirements on Custodial Wallet Providers. Trackin due to the micro nature of the hosted wallets doesn't anticipate falling under any future regulatory oversight; however, in keeping with the ethos of increasing decentralisation and placing control in users' hands Trackin will ahead of this time have replaced any hosted wallet solutions with wallets fully controlled by Trackin users.

### 11. Who Can Use the Services

If you are not yet legally considered an adult where you live (known as the age of majority), you may only use the Services if your parent or guardian agrees to these Terms on your behalf.

  d. Kin Earn and Spend Opportunities.  We make available to you within the Trackin application opportunities from us or third parties to earn or to spend Kin.

While we may bring to your attention that an opportunity is made available by a third party, it is your responsibility to carefully review each opportunity.
